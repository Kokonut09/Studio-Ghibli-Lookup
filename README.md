# Studio-Ghibli-Lookup

This app was my solo project during the solo project phase at Devmountain.

Studio Ghibli Look up is a simple app that provides information about Studio Ghibli's films (e.g. synopsis, voice actors etc.) using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It also provides links to the latest news articles related to Studio Ghibli through Bing News API.

Future Features:
Using the Studio Ghibli API I would like to add more information for each film.
Listing out all characters (not just voice actors who played main roles), locations, animals, vehicles. Essentially using all the information the Studio Ghibli API has to offer.

I would like to build out the favorites tab some more to give it more functionality 

Clean up code some more and properly use protocol and delegates
